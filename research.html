              <p> In this research, we focused mostly on our rigorous novel implementations and iterative result analysis of different cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely EfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image, named as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the pre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. The approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of EfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%, b5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1- 99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong potentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and classification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early stage.</p>

              <p> Nano Rover is a significant approach of cost-efficient surveillance and reconnaissance robot which is fully functional and cost-efficient at the same time. It features the service of active reconnaissance mode with LIDAR sensor, location tracking with GPS Neo 6M module, visual information collection, person detection, weapons detection and identification, gender and age prediction of the hostile and other artificial threat detection, etc. Remote navigation plays as the core controlling system of the robot which is also modifiable through replacement with Internet and satellite navigation system. We modified the conventional Inception-Net architecture with a better hyper-parameter tuning for the successful execution of image processing tasks with a better level of accuracy so far.</p>

              <p> This robotics research project proposes a solution which appears to be a full-fledged Bluetooth controlled Submarine prototype with a sensory chipboard attached inside its endo-skeleton which contains multiple sensors like DHT11 temperature-humidity, dust, CO2 and YL69 pH sensors. The sensory data provides the information of underwater whether the naval environment is habitable for the marine biological species or not, under the terrible effect of global climate change. The submarine prototype is fully functional in the surface and underwater scenario which contains a very unique mechanical design and circuitry with an exceptional sensor data streaming capability which can be used by marine biological researchers and oceanographers professionally as a full-fledged marine ecosystem monitoring device.</p>

                <p> In the rural world of medical services, we
                  generally notice a lot of havoc which generally happens
                  in the hospitals, clinics and related other medical
                  centers. The conditions of Intensive Care Units (ICU) of
                  the rural areas are quite intolerable because of the lack
                  of qualified nurses. Doctors generally prescribe multiple
                  injections for a single patient for each day. Nurses are
                  responsible for the injection process but unfortunately
                  they fail to perform the injection process very often in
                  proper prescribed time in proper amount. This
                  malpractice of treatment quite often results in the
                  terrible sufferings of the ICU patients and sometimes a
                  few patients even die. This study aims to minimize the
                  hazard at the highest accuracy level possible. The
                  research relates to the functionality of Real Time Clock
                  (RTC) which provides the activation of automated time
                  system and triggers the microcontroller's machinery to
                  act according to the time. According to the doctor's
                  prescribed time, injection's medicine will be flowing
                  inside the pipelines and will be injected to the body of
                  the patient through a cannula. In this study, Arduino
                  microcontroller, RTC DS3231 time module, HX 711
                  weight sensors, relay modules, hydraulic pump motors,
                  wifi shield, resistors, MOSFET and breadboard have
                  been used. Following the prescribed time of doctor, the
                  RTC module programs the time for the activation of the
                  microcontroller. The microcontroller activates the
                  hydraulic pump motors following the programmed
                  times. The pump motors then create a vacuum
                  environment inside the pipeline and pass the medicine
                  fluid for injection inside the patient's body through the
                  multiple channel-single cannula. This is consisted of
                  three units: electrical circuitry unit, mechanical unit
                  and timer program with reprogram process unit. The
                  research were carried out through the tests of each and
                  every units to verify that they were working precisely
                  and were manifesting the expected outputs.</p>
