                We secured our position of runner-up at the category of Tech Idea Contest. We demonstrated the idea of "The Smart Injector" over there. The other team member was Saleh Bin Sayeem.
                It was a National Contest where 17 nation-wide selected teams got the chance to participate and only 5 teams could make it to the final round.

                We demonstrated Environment Monitoring System with Machine Learning based Predictive Features at MindSparks'20, AUST. This time Saleh Bin Sayeem led our team "SENSO CODER" and I was the second in command.
                We developed the complex circuitry of monitoring platform on Arduino ATMega and Sensors (Sound, DHT11 temperature-humidity, dust, CO2 and YL69 pH). I implemented a library with The Random Forest Algorithm to get the predictive features of data analysis within the platfrom. The other team members were Kamrul and Tawfiq Anam.

                I led "SENSO CODER" in the National Project Showcasing Competition called "Mecceleration'19" at IUT. We demonstrated "The Smart Injector" for the very first time. 
                There was a massive level of positive reviews and critical acclaims which came from enumerable national and international visitors. Students and experienced teachers from Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, 
                Malaysia, MIST, BUET, BUP, BracU, AIUB and so many other places came across our project, profoundly appreciated us and suggested us to bring up the project to the topmost level of the Government Authority.

                I led my robotics team to participate in a National Robotics Competition at BUET called Robo Carnival 2019. 
                We fought at the Segment of "Robo Soccer" but got eliminated in the quarter final round.
                The other team members were Rajon Sarkar, Mohammad Ali Shuvo and Tarikol Islam Touhid.

                After failing miserably, I shifted another research idea from this robotic prototype which came up 
                with the manifestation of "Nano Rover". This "Nano Rover" later on had its own identity as a 
                multi-sensory surveillance robot with modified inception-net. This research ended winning a 
                "Best Paper Award" in a Springer Nature affiliated international conference in 2021.

                It was time to participate in a National Hackathon to solve some real world problems.
                We joined BUP ICT Fest Hackathon 2018 where we developed an efficient online examination taking 
                platform so that students can avoid the complexities coming from that physical participation.
                We achieved sixth position in this Competition. The other team members were Mohammad Ali Shuvo and 
                Redwan Ahmed Khan.

                countries biggest robotics event ROBOLUTION'18 to participate in. I assembled my team "SENSO CODER" and 
                started developing our autonomous line following robot. Despite having no prior experience, we 
                still secured our place at the finals over the event. We achieved eleventh place after fighting 
                against 75 other teams from the entire country. 
                The other team members were Mohammad Gulzar Hossain, Rajon Sarkar and Hasibul Islam Polok.
